# --- 6. How to Interpret the Results ---
# - antecedents: The item(s) a customer buys.
# - consequents: The item(s) the customer is likely to buy in addition.
# - support: How often the items are bought together.
# - confidence: The probability of buying 'consequents' if 'antecedents' are already in the cart.
# - lift: A value greater than 1 indicates a positive relationship,
#         meaning the items are more likely to be bought together than by random chance.
